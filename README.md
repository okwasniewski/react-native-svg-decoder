# react-native-svg-decoder ðŸ”§

> [!WARNING]
> This library is iOS only.

Extends built-in Image component with SVG capabilities. It uses CoreSVG to render SVG images.

The implementation was heavily inspired by [SDWebImageSVGCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSVGCoder). It uses the same approach to mangle private Apple classes to add SVG support.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-svg-decoder
```

## Usage

Just install the package and use the built-in Image component as usual.
